# DEPRECATED: Jino Agent

This agent has been **DEPRECATED** and removed from the orchestration system.

## Reason for Deprecation

Jino Agent required the JINA_API_KEY environment variable, which cannot be securely managed in Claude Code Web environment. 

## Replacement

The coder agent now has **self-service documentation** via two MCP servers that don't require API keys:

1. **Context7** (Upstash) - Popular frameworks/libraries docs
2. **ctxkit** (ctxkit.dev) - llm.txt discovery from official documentation sites

Both are free and secure for Claude Code Web.

## Migration

If you were using Jino Agent for preliminary research, you can now rely on the coder agent's self-service documentation tools (Context7 + ctxkit).
