# Claude Code Agent Orchestration System v2 🚀

A simple yet powerful orchestration system for Claude Code that uses specialized agents to manage complex projects from start to finish, with mandatory human oversight and visual testing.

## 🎯 What Is This?

This is a **custom Claude Code orchestration system** that transforms how you build software projects. Claude Code itself acts as the orchestrator with its 200k context window, managing the big picture while delegating individual tasks to specialized subagents:

- **🧠 Claude (You)** - The orchestrator with 200k context managing todos and the big picture
- **🔍 Jino Agent** - Web research specialist powered by Jina.ai MCP for docs extraction and searches
- **✍️ Coder Subagent** - Implements one todo at a time in its own clean context
- **👁️ Tester Subagent** - Verifies implementations using Playwright in its own context
- **🆘 Stuck Subagent** - Human escalation point when ANY problem occurs

## ⚡ Key Features

- **AI-Powered Research**: Jino Agent proactively fetches docs and extracts web content using Jina.ai
- **No Fallbacks**: When ANY agent hits a problem, you get asked - no assumptions, no workarounds
- **Visual Testing**: Playwright MCP integration for screenshot-based verification
- **Todo Tracking**: Always see exactly where your project stands
- **Smart Flow**: Claude creates todos → Jino researches → coder implements → tester verifies → repeat
- **Human Control**: The stuck agent ensures you're always in the loop
- **🆕 Local E2B Sandbox**: Secure Docker container for running GitHub Copilot CLI with MCP integrations
- **🆕 E2B Cloud Sandbox**: Cloud-powered sandboxes with Docker MCP Gateway (200+ tools)
- **🆕 Awesome Copilot MCP**: Access community prompts and instructions directly

## 📦 Using in Other Projects

Want to use this orchestration system in your own projects? It's **super easy**!

### Quick Import (Recommended)

From any project, just ask Claude:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
claude

# Then use the slash command:
/import-orchestration from /path/to/ALEX-STACK_v0

# Or simply ask:
"Import the orchestration plugin from /path/to/ALEX-STACK_v0"
```

Claude will automatically:
- ✅ Copy all orchestration files (`.claude/`, `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`, `.taskmaster/`)
- ✅ Verify installation
- ✅ Switch to orchestrator mode
- ✅ Be ready to build!

**That's it!** Claude is now your orchestrator in the new project.

### What You Get

After import, your project has:
- **Orchestrator** - Claude with 200k context managing everything
- **Agent delegation** - coder, tester, planner, jino-agent, stuck
- **PROJECT_ROADMAP.md** - Unified task tracking for multi-agent coordination
- **TASKMASTER** - AI-powered breakdown for extreme complexity (8-10/10)
- **Parallelization** - Multiple coder agents work on independent tasks

## 📖 How to Use

### Starting a Project

When you want to build something, just tell Claude your requirements:

```
You: "Build a todo app with React and TypeScript"
```

Claude will automatically:
1. Create a detailed todo list using TodoWrite
2. Check if research is needed - if yes, invoke **Jino Agent** to fetch docs/search
3. Delegate the first todo to the **coder** subagent (with research if available)
4. The coder implements in its own clean context window
5. Delegate verification to the **tester** subagent (Playwright screenshots)
6. If ANY problem occurs, the **stuck** subagent asks you what to do
7. Mark todo complete and move to the next one
8. Repeat until project complete

### The Workflow

```
USER: "Build X with latest best practices"
    ↓
CLAUDE: Creates detailed todos with TodoWrite
    ↓
    ├─→ Need docs? → JINO AGENT (own context): Uses Jina AI MCP
    │                  ├─→ Extracts clean documentation
    │                  ├─→ Searches web for best practices
    │                  └─→ Returns structured research
    ↓
CLAUDE: Invokes coder subagent for todo #1 (+ research from Jino)
    ↓
CODER (own context): Implements feature with best practices
    ↓
    ├─→ Problem? → Invokes STUCK → You decide → Continue
    ↓
CODER: Reports completion
    ↓
CLAUDE: Invokes tester subagent
    ↓
TESTER (own context): Playwright screenshots & verification
    ↓
    ├─→ Test fails? → Invokes STUCK → You decide → Continue
    ↓
TESTER: Reports success
    ↓
CLAUDE: Marks todo complete, moves to next
    ↓
Repeat until all todos done ✅
```

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Claude (The Orchestrator)
**Your 200k Context Window**

- Creates and maintains comprehensive todo lists
- Sees the complete project from A-Z
- Delegates individual todos to specialized subagents
- Tracks overall progress across all tasks
- Maintains project state and context

**How it works**: Claude IS the orchestrator - it uses its 200k context to manage everything

### Jino Agent (Research Specialist)
**Fresh Context Per Research Task**

- Gets invoked proactively when web research or documentation is needed
- Works in its own clean context window
- Uses **Jina AI Remote MCP Server** for powerful web capabilities:
  - **Jina Reader**: Extracts clean markdown from any URL
  - **Web Search**: AI-powered search for current information
  - **Image Search**: Finds and analyzes images
  - **Embeddings & Reranker**: Semantic search and ranking
- **Preferred over native WebSearch** for documentation and deep content extraction
- **Never uses fallbacks** - invokes stuck agent immediately on errors
- Reports clean, formatted research back to Claude

**When it's used**:
- Fetching documentation (React docs, API references, tutorials)
- Extracting content from URLs (articles, blog posts, guides)
- Web research requiring current best practices
- Finding code examples or technical resources
- Any task where Jina AI's extraction is superior to basic web fetch

### Coder Subagent
**Fresh Context Per Task**

- Gets invoked with ONE specific todo item
- Works in its own clean context window
- Writes clean, functional code
- **Never uses fallbacks** - invokes stuck agent immediately
- Reports completion back to Claude

**When it's used**: Claude delegates each coding todo to this subagent

### Tester Subagent
**Fresh Context Per Verification**

- Gets invoked after each coder completion
- Works in its own clean context window
- Uses **Playwright MCP** to see rendered output
- Takes screenshots to verify layouts
- Tests interactions (clicks, forms, navigation)
- **Never marks failing tests as passing**
- Reports pass/fail back to Claude

**When it's used**: Claude delegates testing after every implementation

### Stuck Subagent
**Fresh Context Per Problem**

- Gets invoked when coder or tester hits a problem
- Works in its own clean context window
- **ONLY subagent** that can ask you questions
- Presents clear options for you to choose
- Blocks progress until you respond
- Returns your decision to the calling agent
- Ensures no blind fallbacks or workarounds

**When it's used**: Whenever ANY subagent encounters ANY problem

## 🚨 The "No Fallbacks" Rule

**This is the key differentiator:**

Traditional AI: Hits error → tries workaround → might fail silently
**This system**: Hits error → asks you → you decide → proceeds correctly

Every agent is **hardwired** to invoke the stuck agent rather than use fallbacks. You stay in control.

## 💡 Example Session

```
You: "Build a modern landing page with React and Tailwind using latest best practices"

Claude creates todos:
  [ ] Research React + Tailwind best practices
  [ ] Set up project with Vite
  [ ] Create hero section component
  [ ] Add contact form with validation
  [ ] Implement responsive design
  [ ] Test all components

Claude invokes jino-agent(todo #1: "Research React + Tailwind best practices")

Jino Agent (own context): Uses Jina AI MCP
  - Uses Jina Reader to extract React 19 docs
  - Uses Jina Reader to extract Tailwind v4 docs
  - Uses Jina Web Search for "React Tailwind 2025 best practices"
  - Synthesizes findings into clean guide
Jino: Reports comprehensive research to Claude

Claude: Marks todo #1 complete ✓

Claude invokes coder(todo #2: "Set up project with Vite" + research from Jino)

Coder (own context): Creates Vite project with React + Tailwind
  - Follows best practices from Jino's research
  - Configures Tailwind v4 correctly
Coder: Reports completion to Claude

Claude invokes tester("Verify project setup and dev server runs")

Tester (own context): Uses Playwright
  - Starts dev server
  - Navigates to localhost
  - Takes screenshot
  - Verifies React app renders
Tester: Reports success to Claude

Claude: Marks todo #2 complete ✓

Claude invokes coder(todo #3: "Create hero section component")

Coder (own context): Implements hero section
Coder: ERROR - Need hero image
Coder: Invokes stuck subagent

Stuck (own context): Asks YOU:
  "Hero section needs an image. How to proceed?"
  Options:
  - Search with Jino Agent for free stock images
  - Use placeholder from placeholder.com
  - Skip image for now

You choose: "Search with Jino Agent for free stock images"

Stuck: Returns your decision to Claude

Claude invokes jino-agent("Search for hero section stock images")

Jino Agent: Uses Jina Image Search
  - Finds relevant hero images
  - Provides URLs and metadata
Jino: Reports image options to Claude

Claude invokes coder(todo #3 continued: "Create hero with image from Jino")

Coder: Implements hero section with selected image
Coder: Reports completion to Claude

... and so on until all todos done
```

## 🔒 E2B Sandboxes for Secure Code Execution

### What is E2B?

E2B (Execute to Build) provides secure, isolated sandbox environments for running AI-generated code safely. We offer **two deployment options**:

#### Option 1: Local Docker Container 🐳
Self-hosted Docker container on your machine with manual MCP configuration.

**Best for:** Development, testing, offline work

```bash
# Quick start with launcher script
./start-e2b-sandbox.sh

# Or build manually
docker build -f Dockerfile.e2b -t alex-stack-e2b:latest .
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace alex-stack-e2b:latest
```

#### Option 2: E2B Cloud Sandbox ☁️
Cloud-managed sandboxes with automatic Docker MCP Gateway integration.

**Best for:** Production, collaboration, scaling

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure credentials in .env
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your E2B_API_KEY and GITHUB_TOKEN

# Create cloud sandbox
npm run create-sandbox
```

## 📝 How It Works Under the Hood

This system leverages Claude Code's [subagent system](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents):

1. **CLAUDE.md** instructs main Claude to be the orchestrator
2. **Subagents** are defined in `.claude/agents/*.md` files
3. **Each subagent** gets its own fresh context window
4. **Main Claude** maintains the 200k context with todos and project state
5. **MCP Servers** are configured in `.mcp.json` for enhanced capabilities:
   - **Playwright MCP** for visual testing
   - **Jina AI MCP** for web search, content extraction, and embeddings

The magic happens because:
- **Claude (200k context)** = Maintains big picture, manages todos
- **Coder (fresh context)** = Implements one task at a time
- **Tester (fresh context)** = Verifies one implementation at a time with Playwright + Jina AI
- **Stuck (fresh context)** = Handles one problem at a time with human input
- **Each subagent** has specific tools and hardwired escalation rules

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Trust Claude** - Let it create and manage the todo list
2. **Review screenshots** - The tester provides visual proof of every implementation
3. **Make decisions when asked** - The stuck agent needs your guidance
4. **Don't interrupt the flow** - Let subagents complete their work
5. **Check the todo list** - Always visible, tracks real progress

## 🔥 Pro Tips

- Use `/agents` command to see all available subagents
- Claude maintains the todo list in its 200k context - check anytime
- Screenshots from tester are saved and can be reviewed
- Each subagent has specific tools - check their `.md` files
- Subagents get fresh contexts - no context pollution!
